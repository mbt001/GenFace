# Face Generation from Speech Descriptions

This project generates realistic human faces from spoken descriptions using deep learning, designed for forensics and police investigations.

- **Speech-to-Text:** Converts verbal facial descriptions to text.
- **Feature Extraction:** Embeds key attributes (gender, age, hair, etc.) from the text.
- **Face Synthesis:** Uses a Progressive GAN to generate a matching synthetic face.
- **Application:** Automates suspect sketching, replacing manual drawing with AI-powered face generation.

## Tech Stack
- Python, TensorFlow
- SpeechRecognition API
- word2vec (Gensim)
- Progressive GAN
- CelebA Dataset
